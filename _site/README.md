Jekyll Project Boilerplate
==========================
A template for building a static website with the Ruby CMS [Jekyll][jekyll], as well as a project-directory template for how I, @ndarville aim to start on each project.

## Installation

Assuming Ruby and Git are installed:

1. `git clone git@github.com:FranklyWeb/jekyll-boilerplate.git`
2. `cd jekyll-boilerplate`
3. `bundle install`
4. `jekyll serve --watch`

This creates a `_site/` folder and starts a `localhost:4000` server.

## Asides
Page files are in [Markdown][markdown], .markdown. They are viewable in any text editor, but try out [Mou][mou] if you want to see the rendered version.

Leave feedback and questions in Issues, if you want.
